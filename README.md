# HTML ATTRIBUTES

# What are HTML ATTRIBUTES?
* HTML Attributes are additional information included within the opening tags of an element
* They make it easy for developers to focus on  a specific element when working with additional files like CSS by making use of their attributes.

# Types of HTML ATTRIBUTES:👩‍🏫
* 🪐Class - it makes it easier when working with CSS to specificly apply certain CSS styles to that specific element by creating a class for your element.
   In this case all elements named after the same class would then have exactly the same CSS styles.
  
* 🎀Id -it makes it easier when working with CSS to specificly apply certain CSS styles to that specific element containing a unique Id ,these changes will 
  only apply on an element with only this unique Id and no 
  other element would be affected at this point.
  In this case all elements can have their own Id's if there's any CSS changes you can then directly make changes using the Id.

* 📢lang-this attribute helps us specify which language the content is in,for example if the content of the language is n English you'd have to specify this 
   way in the code lang ="en".

* 📍dir -this attribute allows you to set the direction flow of your text whether to "LTR" for left-to-right or "RTL" for right-to-left

# ARIA ROLES👩‍⚖️👨‍🌾👲👨‍🎓
# WHAT ARE ARIA ROLES?
* ARIA Roles is the inclusion of users of all types including those with disabilities ,allowing accessebility to websites regardless of different devices to view the content with and also maintaining your webpage with consistent labeling of the elements and their description.

# FORMATTING HTML🛠
* When writing code on html and leave unnecessary spacing between your code ,HTML automaticaly ignores the blank spacing and displayes the content based on how the elements are structured on the code.
* HTML is not case-sensitive but it is advised to keep good practice of using lowercase when writing code.
* To make your code easier to understand for yourself and other developers it is advised to leave comments in between your line of code explaining the 
  purpose of each line or set of code
* This is how you write comments on HTML ,opening tag "<!--" at the start and "-->"closing tag at the end
* HTML has tags that automatically closes themselves with their closing tags ,those that do not have closing tags to this day where tags created in the early years of Tech.

# HTML NAVIGATION AND LINKS🔗📌
 * This how you create a basic link on HTML ,<a href="https://example.com">text to click</a>
 * 📂HTML Navigation allows you to find path/routes to different folders according to the structure and direction of your folder,we use slashes as a symbol to access 
  folders through their paths.
 * 🚗For example if you have an image folder named IMAGES that consist of different folders/albums ,named "myself" ,"family" or "Vacation Pictures" and you wanna 
 access 
  the family folder here's the structure , IMAGES/Vacation-pictures.By places the original folder before the slash indicates where the path starts and by placing the 
  other folder after the slash it indicates that the route now should end on this folder and access it.
 * 🛣If  the folder you wanted to access is inside the second folder which is "Vacation Pictures" you will just need to add a slash after "Vacation Pictures" and then add the name of the folder you wanna access and end there,so the deeper you wanna accesss you folder the longer or more slashes you add after every indicatin of where an actual folder has been made. e.g IMAGES/Vacation-pictures/Paris
