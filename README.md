# HTML ATTRIBUTES

# What are HTML ATTRIBUTES?
* HTML Attributes are additional information included within the opening tags of an element
* They make it easy for developers to focus on  a specific element when working with additional files like CSS by making use of their attributes.

# Types of HTML ATTRIBUTES:👩‍🏫
* 🪐Class - it makes it easier when working with CSS to specificly apply certain CSS styles to that specific element by creating a class for your element.
   In this case all elements named after the same class would then have exactly the same CSS styles.
  
* 🎀Id -it makes it easier when working with CSS to specificly apply certain CSS styles to that specific element containing a unique Id ,these changes will 
  only apply on an element with only this unique Id and no 
  other element would be affected at this point.
  In this case all elements can have their own Id's if there's any CSS changes you can then directly make changes using the Id.

* 📢lang-this attribute helps us specify which language the content is in,for example if the content of the language is n English you'd have to specify this 
   way in the code lang ="en".

# FORMATTING HTML🛠
* When writing code on html and leave unnecessary spacing between your code ,HTML automaticaly ignores the blank spacing and displayes the content based on how the elements are structured on the code.
* HTML is not case-sensitive but it is advised to keep good practice of using lowercase when writing code.
* To make your code easier to understand for yourself and other developers it is advised to leave comments in between your line of code explaining the 
  purpose of each line or set of code
* This is how you write comments on HTML ,opening tag "<!--" at the start and "-->"closing tag at the end
* HTML has tags that automatically closes themselves with their closing tags ,those that do not have closing tags to this day where tags created in the early years of Tech.
