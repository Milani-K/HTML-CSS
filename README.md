# What are HTML ATTRIBUTES?

# Types of HTML ATTRIBUTES:👩‍🏫
* 🪐Class - it makes it easier when working with CSS to specificly apply certain CSS styles to that specific element by creating a class for your element.
   In this case all elements named after the same class would then have exactly the same CSS styles.
  
* 🎀Id -it makes it easier when working with CSS to specificly apply certain CSS styles to that specific element containing a unique Id ,these changes will 
  only apply on an element with only this unique Id and no 
  other element would be affected at this point.
  In this case all elements can have their own Id's if there's any CSS changes you can then directly make changes using the Id.

* 📢lang-this attribute helps us specify which language the content is in,for example if the content of the language is n English you'd have to specify this 
   way in the code lang ="en".
* 📍dir -this attribute allows you to set the direction flow of your text whether to "LTR" for left-to-right or "RTL" for right-to-left
